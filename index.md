## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ChuangLan/Leetcode/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- Bulleted

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ChuangLan/Leetcode/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Solutions

### 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

`
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        // if(nums == null || nums.length < 2) return res;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(map.containsKey(nums[i])){
                res[0] = map.get(nums[i]);
                res[1] = i;
                break;
            }
            else map.put(target - nums[i], i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
